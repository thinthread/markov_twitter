Laws of gravitation. Two bodies exert a force upon each other which varies inversely as the square of
the distance between them varies directly due to the product of their masses. If a body reacts to a force by accelerating or by changing its velocity, more if the mass is lower, inversely as the mass, then I have said enough about the law of gravitation that needs to be said.
